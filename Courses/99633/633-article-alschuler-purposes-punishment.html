<br>CENTENNIAL TRIBUTE ESSAY: The Changing Purposes of Criminal Punishment: A 
Retrospective on the Past Century and Some Thoughts about the Next

<strong>SUMMARY:</strong>
<br> ...  This Essay, however, examines two unmistakably consequential shifts in 
the stated objectives of punishment. ...  Allen's work encouraged a search for 
limits, and scholars like Stanford's Herbert Packer and Chicago's Norval Morris 
contended that although moral desert or retribution could never justify 
punishment, it should limit the punishments society imposes for other reasons. 
...  The dominant goal of criminal punishment changed almost in an instant, and 
the first became last. ...  When sentencing authorities in the late twentieth 
century took account of offender characteristics, they focused more on 
characteristics indicating dangerousness than on those indicating culpability. 
...  One can discern this new penology in sentencing guidelines and mandatory 
minimum sentences that allocate punishment wholesale rather than retail. ...  
It contends that retribution, a seemingly archaic, backwards-looking goal 
dismissed by the champions of rehabilitation at one end of the twentieth 
century and by the champions of 
&quot;crime control&quot; at the other, merits recognition as the central purpose of criminal 
punishment. ...  Sanctions matter to Adam less because his own principal reason 
for law observance is the fear of punishment than because sanctions applied to 
others reinforce his sense of reciprocity and mutual obligation. ...  Adam's 
tale brings the central reason for imposing criminal punishment into focus. ...

<strong>TEXT:</strong>
<br>
&#160;[*1]&#160; 

<br><br> Discussions of the textbook purposes of criminal punishment--retribution, 
deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation 
n1--some-times seem too abstract to matter. This Essay, however, examines two 
unmistakably consequential shifts in the stated objectives of punishment. It 
describes America's turn to rehabilitative goals early in the twentieth 
century, the persistence of these goals through most of the century, and the 
demise of rehabilitation and emergence of a 
&quot;new penology&quot; in the century's final quarter. It contends that both American revolutions in 
penal objectives were mistaken. Retribution, the purpose of punishment most 
disparaged from the beginning of the century through the end, merits 
recognition as the criminal law's central objective.  

<br><br> I. The Dawn of the Twentieth Century 

<br><br> The twentieth century began with the confident march of rehabilitative 
trumpets. The nation's first juvenile court, established in 1899 in Cook 
County, became a model for reform throughout America. 
n2 The guiding principle of this court was that juvenile delinquents should be 
helped, not blamed. Society's best interests matched the child's.  

&#160;[*2]&#160; 

<br><br> During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, an overwhelming 
majority of states also approved two other major penal reforms: probation 
(treatment in the community for juveniles and adults) and indeterminate 
sentences (grounded on the view that a parole board could monitor a prisoner's 
progress toward rehabilitation and release him under supervision at the 
appropriate time). 
n3 All of these reforms deemphasized the historic view, voiced by William 
Blackstone, that 
&quot;punishments are . . . only inflicted for abuse of that free will, which God has 
given to man.&quot; 
n4 

<br><br> Many early twentieth-century reformers doubted their ability to blame. They 
saw people as the far-from-divine products of heredity, social circumstances, 
random breeding, and Darwinian struggle. They and others also insisted that 
blame was functionless and that society should direct its efforts to more 
constructive goals. Like the rest of law, criminal punishment should look 
forward, not backward. Psychology and sociology, the handmaidens of 
consequentialist jurisprudence, would determine the causes of crime and what 
social reforms and treatment programs would correct them. 

<br><br> The turn-of-the-century penal reforms were part of a jurisprudential 
revolution that reshaped all of American law. This revolution deemphasized 
corrective justice in civil proceedings just as it did ret-ribution in criminal 
proceedings. 
n5 It often is called 
&quot;the revolt against formalism,&quot; 
n6 but it is better understood as a revolt against natural law or objective 
concepts of right and wrong. 
n7 In positive terms, it could be called the 
&quot;consequentialist&quot; or 
&quot;pragmatic&quot; revolution. Its ideas developed in the period following the American Civil War 
and the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. These ideas 
triumphed, at least among intellectuals, within less than half a century. 

<br><br> Criminal law was more resistant to the new jurisprudence than other fields. 
Roscoe Pound complained in 1909, 
&quot;The truth is . . . criminal law is the most archaic part of our legal system.&quot; 
n8 It 
&quot;is so rooted in theological ideas of free will and moral responsibility and 
juridical ideas of retribution . . . that we by no means make what we 

&#160;[*3]&#160; should of our scientific discoveries.&quot; 
n9 Criminal law was--and is still--a backwater in which subjective standards of 
culpability and talk of personal blame persist. 

<br><br> The 1870 meeting of the National Congress on Penitentiary and Reformatory 
Discipline effectively inaugurated the movement that produced the 
twentieth-century reforms. 
n10 The Congress's Declaration of Principles 
&quot;arraigned society itself as in no slight degree accountable for&quot; crime, declared that 
&quot;the supreme aim of prison discipline is the reformation of criminals,&quot; and concluded that 
&quot;sentences limited only by satisfactory proof of reformation should be 
substituted for those measured by mere lapse of time.&quot; 
n11 The Declaration added, 
&quot;Repeated short sentences for minor criminals are worse than useless . . . . 
Reformation is a work of time; and a benevolent regard to the good of the 
criminal himself, as well as to the protection of society, requires that his 
sentence be long enough for reformatory processes to take effect.&quot; 
n12 

<br><br> In 1881, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. declared, 
&quot;Prevention would . . . seem to be the chief and only universal purpose of 
punishment.&quot; 
n13 Holmes, however, championed deterrence rather than rehabilitation. He revealed 
that the deterrent worldview could be as deterministic and as uninterested in 
blame as the rehabilitationist: 

<br><br> 

<br><br> If I were having a philosophical talk with a man I was going to have hanged . 
. . I should say, I don't doubt that your act was inevitable for you but to 
make it more avoidable by others we propose to sacrifice you to the common 
good. You may regard yourself as a soldier dying for your country if you like. 
But the law must keep its promises. 
n14 

<br><br> 

<br><br> Progressive reformers generally echoed the National Penitentiary Congress 
while their critics echoed Holmes. Gino Carlo Speranza wrote in 1904: 

&#160;[*4]&#160; 

<br><br> 

<br><br> The conception of punishment as a defence to crime has gone into bankruptcy: 
it neither defends nor deters. Criminal therapeutics must take its place; that 
is, where a cure is possible, let the remedial agencies suggested by 
criminologic and sociologic science have full scope. But where juridic 
therapeutics fail, let there be no mistaken altruism to perpetuate the 
unfittest. 
n15 

<br><br> 

<br><br> Roscoe Pound spoke of the American legal system's 
&quot;exaggerated respect for the individual,&quot; 
n16 declared that behavioral science had 
&quot;routed&quot; the concept of free will, 
n17 and wrote, 
&quot;We recognize that in order to deal with crime in an intelligent and practical 
manner we must give up the retributive theory.&quot; 
n18 

<br><br> John H. Wigmore joined Holmes rather than Speranza and Pound. He called 
deterrence 
&quot;the kingpin of the criminal law&quot; 
n19 and condemned 
&quot;that false sympathy and dangerous weakening that is apt to arise on first 
acceptance of the biopsychologic doctrine of Determinism.&quot; 
n20 Wigmore opposed only false sympathy and dangerous weakening, however, not 
determinism itself. He wrote, 

<br><br> 

<br><br> The measures of the modern penal law are not based on moral blame, but on 
social self-defense. When there is a weed in your garden, and you cut it down, 
you do not do this on any theory of the moral blame of the weed, but simply on 
the theory that you are entitled to keep weeds out of your garden. 
n21 

<br><br> 

<br><br> In 1924, Clarence Darrow's twelve-hour summation saved from the gallows 
University of Chicago law student Nathan Leopold and his friend Richard Loeb 
(who until his arrest expected to enter the 

&#160;[*5]&#160; Law School himself). 
n22 After Leopold and Loeb pleaded guilty to the murder of Bobby Franks, Darrow 
argued to the sentencing judge, John Caverly: 

<br><br> 

<br><br> What had this boy to do with it? He was not his own father; he was not his own 
mother; he was not his own grandparents. All of this was handed to him. He did 
not surround himself with governesses and wealth. He did not make himself. And 
yet he is to be compelled to pay. 

<br><br> There was a time in England . . . when judges used to . . . call juries to try 
a horse, a dog, a pig, for crime. . . . Animals were tried. Do you mean to tell 
me that Dickie Loeb had any more to do with his making than any other product 
of heredity that is born upon the earth? 

<br><br> . . . 

<br><br> Your Honor, I am almost ashamed to talk about it. I can hardly imagine we are 
in the 20th century. And yet there are men who seriously say that for what 
Nature has done, for what life has done, for what training has done, you should 
hang these boys. 
n23 

<br><br> * * * 

<br><br> Is Dickie Loeb to blame because [ ] of the infinite forces that conspired to 
form him, the infinite forces that were at work producing him ages before he 
was born? . . . Is he to blame that his machine is imperfect? . . . I know that 
somewhere in the past that entered into him something missed. It may be 
defective nerves. It may be a defective heart or liver. It may be defective 
endocrine glands. I know it is something. I know that nothing happens in this 
world without a cause. 
n24 

<br><br> 

<br><br> Wigmore's paean to deterrence responded to Darrow's argument. 

<br><br> At the Sociology Department of the University of Chicago, the first 
&quot;Chicago School&quot; used the city as a laboratory and developed 

&#160;[*6]&#160; pathbreaking cultural and environmental explanations of crime. 
n25 The university established America's first chair of police science, the 
precursor of today's many schools and departments of criminal justice, in 1929. 
n26 Scholars, reformers, and many criminal justice officials continued to view 
crime as a public health problem susceptible to diagnosis and cure.  

<br><br> II. A Quiet Afternoon 

<br><br> Rehabilitation remained the central professed goal of American criminal 
justice--at least in most public rhetoric--until the final quarter of the 
twentieth century. 
n27 In 1949 the Supreme Court declared, 
&quot;Retribution is no longer the dominant objective of the criminal law. 
Reformation and rehabilitation of offenders have become important goals.&quot; 
n28 In 1952, the Court spoke of 
&quot;a tardy and unfinished substitution of deterrence and reformation in place of 
retaliation and vengeance as the motivation for public prosecution.&quot; 
n29 In 1962, the Court held that narcotics addiction was an illness whose 
punishment violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause. 
n30 The Court, however, qualified its ruling sufficiently that it was able to beat 
a speedy retreat. 
n31 

<br><br> The Model Penal Code issued by the American Law Institute in 1962 endorsed 
almost the entire list of penal purposes, 
n32 but it mentioned retribution only as a limiting principle. 
n33 Its sentencing provisions emphasized indeterminacy and treatment. They 
required that every penitentiary sentence be for at least one year so that 
correctional authorities could adequately diagnose each offender. 
n34 Moreover, 

&#160;[*7]&#160; the code supplied the principal alternative to the traditional 
&quot;right-wrong&quot; test of legal insanity. 
n35 Much of the post-World War II effort to substitute treatment for punishment 
had focused on the terms of this defense. 
n36 The Model Penal Code's formulation was adopted by about half the states and 
every United States Court of Appeals but one. 
n37 

<br><br> Francis A. Allen, a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty, 
was the chair of the drafting committee for the Illinois Criminal Code of 1961, 
one of the earliest codes to adopt the Model Penal Code's insanity defense and 
sentencing principles. 
n38 Allen's scholarship, however, noted that the rehabilitative ideal had a 
troublesome side, for it seemed to authorize both lengthy restrictions of 
liberty and broad assumptions of governmental power over offenders' 
personalities. 
n39 

<br><br> Allen's work encouraged a search for limits, and scholars like Stanford's 
Herbert Packer and Chicago's Norval Morris 
n40 contended that although moral desert or retribution could never justify 
punishment, it should limit the punishments society imposes for other reasons. 
n41 The Packer-Morris position sought to tame the utility monster, 

&#160;[*8]&#160; and although Packer and Morris did not say so, it required the rejection of 
determinism. Moreover, the Supreme Court seemed to recognize the danger of 
rehabilitative rhetoric when it imposed many traditional safeguards of the 
criminal process on juvenile delinquency proceedings. 
n42 

<br><br> Although scholars and courts increasingly recognized the need to constrain 
rehabilitative goals, these goals remained dominant. 
n43 In 1968, 72 percent of the respondents to a Harris poll declared that the 
prison system's primary purpose should be rehabilitation. 
n44 In 1970, soon after concluding his service as Attorney General, Ramsey Clark 
(University of Chicago Law School class of 1951) 
n45 revealed that the orthodox progressive view of criminal justice had changed 
little since the start of the twentieth century: 

<br><br> 

<br><br> Rehabilitation must be the goal of modern corrections. Every other 
consideration should be subordinated to it. To rehabilitate is to give health, 
freedom from drugs and alcohol, to provide education, vocational training, 
understanding and the ability to contribute to society. 

<br><br> . . . 

<br><br> Rehabilitation is individual salvation. What achievement can give society 
greater satisfaction than to afford the offender the chance, once lost, to live 
at peace, to fulfill himself and to help 

&#160;[*9]&#160; others? Rehabilitation is also the one clear way that criminal justice 
processes can significantly reduce crime. 
n46 

<br><br> 

<br><br> III. The Sunset of the Century 

<br><br> Within fifteen years of Ramsey Clark's remarks, rehabilitation had gone from 
the top of most scholars' and reformers' lists of the purposes of punishment to 
the bottom. The dominant goal of criminal punishment changed almost in an 
instant, and the first became last. 

<br><br> The demise of rehabilitation was attributable less to jurisprudential 
reflection than to apparent empirical failure. After Vietnam and Watergate, 
Americans were skeptical of government's ability to achieve its goals, and 
ambitious rehabilitative programs seemed especially inviting targets for 
reform. The title of an influential 1974 article asked What Works? In essence 
the article answered, 
&quot;nothing.&quot; 
n47 This article reviewed all of the empirical evaluations of rehabilitative 
programs then in print in England and America, and found 231 that met minimal 
methodological standards. It concluded, 
&quot;With few and isolated exceptions, the rehabilitative efforts that have been 
reported so far have had no appreciable effect on recidivism.&quot; 
n48 Later studies (including one by the author of What Works?) declared this 
judgment too pessimistic, 
n49 but social science plainly had not provided the happy answers its early 
champions expected. 

<br><br> The sentencing reform movement of the 1970s and 1980s prompted America's 
reconsideration of its penal goals. Initially, this movement seemed to be about 
reducing the sentencing disparities that can result from the differing views 
and personalities of judges. The hawks and the doves of criminal process both 
welcomed it. In 

<br><br> retrospect, however, the movement appears to have been a Trojan horse whose 
procedural facade concealed the soldiers of substantive change. It proved to be 
less about correcting disparities than about radically altering sentencing 
standards, deemphasizing the personal characteristics of offenders, 
substituting aggregated for individualized sentences, enhancing the power of 
prosecutors, and increasing the 

&#160;[*10]&#160; severity of criminal penalties. 
n50 

<br><br> A few sentencing reformers spoke explicitly of abandoning forward-looking 
preventive goals and embracing a policy of 
&quot;just deserts.&quot; 
n51 Their concept of 
&quot;desert,&quot; however, was primitive, emphasizing social harm rather than the character and 
culpability of offenders. Statutes and guidelines took the form of crime 
tariffs. 
n52 The earliest of the new determinate sentencing statutes, enacted in California 
in 1976, declared: 

<br><br> 

<br><br> The Legislature finds and declares that the purpose of imprisonment for crime 
is punishment. This purpose is best served by terms proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offense with provision for uniformity in the sentences of 
offenders committing the same offense under similar circumstances. 
n53 

<br><br> 

<br><br> Talk of 
&quot;just deserts&quot; soon vanished, but the emphasis on quantifiable harm rather than circumstances 
or personal characteristics persisted. In 1987, a preliminary draft of the 
Federal Sentencing Guidelines declared, 
&quot;To the extent that principles derived from retributive and crime control models 
conflict, justice for the public is the overreaching goal.&quot; 
n54 The Sentencing Commission (perhaps embarrassed by its inadvertent substitution 
of the word 
&quot;overreaching&quot; for the word it apparently intended) used more amorphous language in its final 
draft but did not significantly alter the Guidelines' content. 
n55 

&#160;[*11]&#160; 

<br><br> When sentencing authorities in the late twentieth century took account of 
offender characteristics, they focused more on characteristics indicating 
dangerousness than on those indicating culpability. Notably, the Virginia 
Sentencing Commission declared that a drug, larceny, or fraud defendant who 
&quot;scored&quot; ten or more points should go to prison. It then directed judges to add six 
points whenever the offender was younger than twenty. 
n56 Until the end of the twentieth century, virtually everyone had regarded youth 
as a mitigating rather than an aggravating circumstance. The Virginia 
Commission also directed judges to add points for being unmarried, unemployed, 
or male. 
n57 

<br><br> Late twentieth-century crime control emphasized incapacitation and deterrence. 
For a time, 
&quot;selective incapacitation&quot; (the statistical identification and long-term confinement of a relatively 
small group of offenders believed responsible for a disproportionate share of 
crime) was fashionable, 
n58 but variables other than prior criminal record added very little to the 
predictive power of the social scientists' formulas. 
n59 Economists emphasized deterrence, and they sometimes were influential. For 
example, although most Americans regard stealing money from the government as a 
more serious offense than failing to pay the same amount in taxes, 
n60 the United States Sentencing Commission punished the tax evasion more 
severely. Because tax evaders were detected less frequently than thieves, the 
Commission approved the harsher punishment for deterrent reasons. 
n61 

<br><br> Although one can describe the crime control techniques of the last 
quarter-century in terms of traditional purposes of punishment, they differ 
from earlier measures. Scholars have spoken of a 
&quot;new penology&quot; 

&#160;[*12]&#160; that emphasizes monitoring, risk management, and the control of dangerous 
groups. 
n62 This penology regards the criminal justice system as an ever-more prominent 
component--indeed, the dominant component--of society's response to an enduring 
&quot;underclass.&quot; Its focus is on system rationality and actuarial thinking. Rather than treat 
cases and people one by one, the new penology treats cases and people in 
groups. 

<br><br> One can discern this new penology in sentencing guidelines and mandatory 
minimum sentences that allocate punishment wholesale rather than retail. The 
new penology also is evident in a number of other innovations and practices: 
&quot;real offense sentencing&quot; (the practice of adding punishment-enhancing points not only for crimes of 
which a defendant has been convicted but also for other crimes described as 
&quot;relevant conduct&quot;); 
n63 supposed alternatives to incarceration that do not in fact reduce the number 
of people sentenced to confinement but instead widen the net of penal control; 
n64 preventive detention prior to trial; 
n65 mass searches; 
n66 gang loitering ordinances, youth curfews, and order-maintenance policing; 
n67 limitations of the insanity 

&#160;[*13]&#160; defense; 
n68 requirements that sex offenders register and give public notice of their 
presence in a community; 
n69 the confinement of sex offenders who are not sufficiently mentally ill to 
satisfy ordinary civil commitment standards but who have completed their 
criminal sentences; 
n70 restrictions of habeas corpus; 
n71 and requiring the trial and punishment of many juveniles as adults. 
n72 

<br><br> The politics of crime contributed to the change in penology, and the 1960s 
heralded the change. This decade was a period of increasing crime, youthful 
experimentation with drugs, police repression of civil rights demonstrators, 
draft-card and flag burning, Stokely Carmichael, Jane Fonda, the assassinations 
of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., Black 
Panthers, Richard Speck, the appearance of a University of Chicago Law School 
graduate on the F.B.I.'s ten-most-wanted list, 
n73 sexual liberation, the Chicago Eight, and the Warren Court's due process 
revolution. Although political calls for tough punishments were nothing new, 
the presidential election of 1964 appears to have been the first in which a 
major-party candidate, Barry Goldwater, made crime a national issue. Goldwater 
lost badly, but in 1968 Richard Nixon supported the 
&quot;peace forces&quot; against the 
&quot;criminal forces,&quot; called for a new attorney general, and won. Crime remained an issue in 
subsequent presidential elections--perhaps most notably in 1988 when George 
H.W. Bush, after carefully testing voter responses to potential campaign 
issues, made Willie Horton and the Massachusetts prison furlough program a 
model of negative campaigning and appeal to fear.  

&#160;[*14]&#160; 

<br><br> As the new penology grew in influence, the number of inmates in state and 
federal prisons increased from 196,000 in 1972 to 1,159,000 in 1997--a nearly 
six-fold increase in 25 years. 
n74 A similar explosion in local jail populations has brought the total number of 
Americans behind bars to more than 2,000,000. 
n75 In the decade from 1985 to 1995, federal and state governments opened an 
average of one new prison each week. 
n76 Our current rate of incarceration--roughly 1 of every 150 Americans--is 6 to 
10 times the rate of other Western industrialized countries. 
n77 It is higher than that of every other nation whose rate we can approximate 
except Russia's. 
n78 This difference between the United States and other industrialized nations is 
explained more by our penal policies than by our notvery-different crime rates. 
n79 The United States not only incarcerates a higher proportion of its population 
than other Western democracies; it is also the only Western democracy to retain 
the death penalty, and the number of executions has been rising. 
n80 David Garland writes: 

<br><br> 

<br><br> Imprisonment becomes mass imprisonment when it ceases to be the incarceration 
of individual offenders and becomes the systematic imprisonment of whole groups 
of the population. In the case of the USA, the group concerned is, of course, 
young black males in large urban centres. For these sections of the population, 
imprisonment has become normalized. It has come to be a regular, predictable 
part of experience, rather than a rare and infrequent event. 
n81 

<br><br> 

<br><br> IV. Making Sense of Criminal Punishment 

<br><br> In retrospect, American penology in the twentieth century appears to have been 
a mistake. Optimistic reformers led penology from its traditional path early in 
the century, and disillusioned reformers marched it deeper into the woods at 
the century's end.  

&#160;[*15]&#160; 

<br><br> This Part turns from history to jurisprudence. It contends that retribution, a 
seemingly archaic, backwards-looking goal dismissed by the champions of 
rehabilitation at one end of the twentieth century and by the champions of 
&quot;crime control&quot; at the other, merits recognition as the central purpose of criminal 
punishment. 

<br><br> The term retribution is often misunderstood. A retributivist believes that the 
imposition of deserved punishment is an intrinsic good. This proposition 
defines her as a retributivist, and it is the only proposition to which she 
must be committed. Her view of punishment separates her sharply from people who 
regard punishment as an intrinsic evil--who declare with Jeremy Bentham, 
&quot;All punishment in itself is evil. . . . If it ought at all to be admitted, it 
ought only to be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater evil.&quot; 
n82 

<br><br> The champions of retribution and its critics have combined to give it bad 
press. Although a retributivist must believe that the imposition of deserved 
punishment is an intrinsic good, she need not believe that it is the only 
intrinsic good. She need not join Immanuel Kant in the view that imposing just 
punishment is a categorical imperative. 
n83 She need not join Michael Moore in saying that the retributivist punishes only 
because the offender deserves it. 
n84 She need not deny the legitimacy of other goals of punishment. She need not 
join James Fitzjames Stephen in the belief that 
&quot;it is morally right to hate criminals.&quot; 
n85 She may impose punishment with sadness rather than with what Jeffrie Murphy 
calls 
&quot;retributive hatred.&quot; 
n86 

<br><br> A recently invented mechanical device, the Pulverizer, supplies a test of 
whether one views retribution to some degree as a virtue independent of its 
consequences--that is, whether one supports retributivism as a deontological 
position. This imaginary machine also tests whether one regards retribution, 
not merely as a limiting principle, but as an affirmative reason for punishing. 
 

&#160;[*16]&#160; 

<br><br> The Pulverizer instantly and painlessly dematerializes murderers. To maximize 
its deterrent effect, its inventors have proposed using it for televised 
executions at the halftime of the Super Bowl. Or, to be more forthcoming, 
everyone believes the Pulverizer dematerializes murderers. In reality, it 
transports them to Candy Mountain where they enjoy better lives than they have 
ever known. The inventors of the Pulverizer realized that, compared to actual 
executions, simulated executions would be Pareto efficient. A murderer's 
pretended execution coupled with his banishment to a lovely mountain in a 
galaxy far, far away would make at least one person (the murderer) better off 
and no one worse off. 
n87 

<br><br> People who oppose use of the Pulverizer must believe that efficiency and 
consequences are not everything. They believe that rewards and punishments 
should be allocated at least partly on the basis of desert. 

<br><br> Although the classical retributive position is deontological, a retributivist 
who emphasizes the beneficial consequences of her position is not cheating. 
When someone is convinced that her position has good consequences, to ask 
whether she would take the same position if she did not believe in its good 
consequences is to ask an impossible question. Socrates said that justice is a 
good of the highest order--a good to be valued both for itself and for its 
consequences. 
n88 The intrinsic and consequential virtues of justice cannot entirely be untied. 

<br><br> Paul Robinson and John Darley recently published a fine article with an even 
finer title, The Utility of Desert. 
n89 Robinson and Darley, however, missed the principal effect of justice on 
behavior, and most other commentators have missed it too. 
n90 

<br><br> A familiar consequentialist argument for retribution--one not endorsed by 
Robinson and Darley--is that law must accommodate 

&#160;[*17]&#160; the retributive sentiments of the public to prevent lynchings, blood feuds, 
and other ugly forms of self-help. 
n91 Another argument--also blessedly unendorsed by Robinson and Darley--is that 
the act of punishing promotes social solidarity. 
n92 The society that slays together stays together. Robinson and Darley regard the 
criminal law principally as a signaling mechanism. They speak of expressing 
social disapproval, of shaping norms, and of moral education. Retributive 
justice can do these things, but it also can do more. 

<br><br> I have argued that somewhere in the psychology of most of us is an implicit 
&quot;giving-receiving&quot; ratio. Some people--a few--may give regardless of whether they receive 
anything in return. Others may take and never give. Most people, however, fall 
into neither of these categories. Some of them give two, three, or ten times 
what they receive, yet even these people are likely to cease giving when they 
sense that the 
&quot;return for giving&quot; ratio has grown too far out of line. Criminal punishment is one of the social 
institutions that helps to keep the 
&quot;return for giving&quot; ratio in balance. 
n93 

<br><br> 

<br><br> I offered a parable of parking violation to explain my thesis: 

<br><br> Several years ago, Adam moved to a neighborhood in Chicago in which parking 
regulations were seldom enforced. He frequently found his way and his vision 
blocked by unlawfully parked, unticketed cars. As Adam grew accustomed to the 
realities of life in this neighborhood, his own parking behavior changed. 

<br><br> Adam still does not park in . . . spaces reserved for the handicapped. When 
the only available parking space is too close to an intersection to be lawful, 
however, Adam takes it. Adam was a nicer person and a better citizen when he 
lived in Colorado. Adam also was happier. When he could improve other people's 
lives (or, more modestly, facilitate their driving and parking) with confidence 
that most of them would do the same for him, he felt better about himself and 
his community. 
n94 

<br><br> 

<br><br> The lack of parking-law enforcement in Adam's neighborhood changed his 
behavior. The principal reason for his violation of the 

&#160;[*18]&#160; parking laws, however, was not that he thought he could get away with it. It 
was not that he feared punishment less than he did in his former neighborhood. 
It was not that he was less concerned about incurring social disapproval. It 
was not that he was less educated about the wrongfulness of illegal parking. 

<br><br> Adam would have desisted from his lawlessness if only his neighbors had 
desisted from theirs. When he was required to endure the burdens of life among 
incorrigible parking violators, however, he thought himself a fool not to 
capture a portion of the benefits. Adam, I noted, 

<br><br> 

<br><br> is unwilling to do much more than his share. He would prefer a regime of 
mutual cooperation to one of every person for himself, but he prefers a regime 
of every person for himself to one of 
&quot;cooperation for suckers.&quot; In Adam's neighborhood in Chicago, the bonds of the social compact have 
weakened. 

<br><br> . . . 

<br><br> Sanctions matter to Adam less because his own principal reason for law 
observance is the fear of punishment than because sanctions applied to others 
reinforce his sense of reciprocity and mutual obligation. 
n95 

<br><br> 

<br><br> Adam's tale brings the central reason for imposing criminal punishment into 
focus. Withholding punishment is inappropriate when doing so would encourage 
people to conclude, 
&quot;Everyone else is looking out for themselves, and I'll be a fool unless I become 
a little bit like them.&quot; When withholding criminal punishment would leave the giving-receiving ratio 
out of balance and make selfish action more likely, society has good reason to 
punish. 

<br><br> Sometimes, however, withholding punishment does not undercut the social 
contract or the general sense of reciprocity and mutual obligation. The 
wrongdoer may not seem to be a freerider; he may appear to be more sinned 
against than sinning; he may have had no real choice; he may have been 
subjected to extraordinary temptations; he may have been too immature to be 
responsible; he may have suffered enough; we may accept his apology and 
expression of remorse as sincere. Retributivism takes these circumstances into 
account without strain or rationalization.  The other textbook purposes of 
punishment do not. 
n96 Recognizing the need to take circumstances like these into account yields no 
metric for punishment and allows room for other, 

&#160;[*19]&#160; non-retributive goals to influence an offender's punishment. Blame, however, 
remains at the core of the criminal process. 

<br><br> Part of retributivism's bad press stems from the perception that its object is 
to match punishment to harm. Using the word 
&quot;retribution&quot; as a prompt in a game of free association probably would evoke one response 
more frequently than any other: 
&quot;an eye for an eye.&quot; Envisioning retribution as 
&quot;an eye for an eye&quot; makes the other purposes of punishment look good. Desert, however, not harm, 
is what retributivism is about, and desert depends as much or more on 
circumstances and personal characteristics as upon physical actions and harm. 
The formula 
&quot;an eye for an eye&quot; is horrifying precisely because it does not adequately take account of an 
offender's culpability. 
n97 

<br><br> The consequential argument for retributivism offered above--that keeping the 
giving-receiving ratio in balance promotes a sense of mutual obligation--turns 
on how a society perceives desert rather than on desert itself. When 
perceptions of desert conflict, however, the concept that emerges from 
democratic processes is probably the nearest approximation of desert a polity 
can attain. 
n98 Official judgments of blame are likely to reflect either the majority's own 
view of desert or its recognition that officials with greater knowledge, time, 
or other advantage can make sounder judgments than the majority itself. The 
concept of desert that emerges from democratic processes ordinarily will be 
widely shared or respected. It will have the utilitarian virtue of promoting a 
sense of reciprocity. Moreover, recognizing that criminal punishment is not 
simply an instrumental good discourages unweighted procedural tradeoffs of the 
sort that have characterized the new penology. 

<br><br> David Dolinko has written, 
&quot;One commonplace of moral reasoning is that 'ought' implies 'can'--people cannot 
be blamed for conduct they could not have avoided.&quot; 
n99 Twentieth-century reformers gave up on retribution largely because they gave 
up on human autonomy, a concept they believed science had discredited. 
&quot;I know nothing happens in this world without a cause,&quot; Clarence Darrow told the sentencing judge in the Leopold-Loeb case. It was 
turtles all the way down. 

<br><br> Philosophers continue to write about free will, recently offering and 
criticizing a strange series of 
&quot;compatibilist&quot; arguments that free 

&#160;[*20]&#160; will and determinism can both be true. 
n100 The conundrums of free will remain mysteries, however, and whichever side 
bears the burden of proof is sure to lose. I cannot prove you have free will, 
and you cannot prove I don't. 

<br><br> The seventeenth-century shift in focus from irregularities in nature 
(miracles) to regularities or patterns changed the world for the better. Of 
course, the search for material causes of mental phenomena should proceed as 
far as it will go. The methodological premises of the scientific enterprise, 
however, remain premises, not answers. 

<br><br> The philosopher Robert Fogelin once described his fourteen-year-old son's 
junior-high-school science project--a crab machine. This machine consisted of a 
photoelectric beam and two pairs of pincers. It seized any object that 
interrupted the beam. Fogelin remarked, 
&quot;That is all there is to a crab, and in fifty years we will know it is all there 
is to us.&quot; 
n101 

<br><br> Consciousness, however, seems to distinguish a crab from a crab machine, and 
it clearly distinguishes us from computers. The phenomenon of consciousness 
remains terra incognita to neurobiologists and cognitive scientists--an 
impenetrable wall for now. 
n102 

<br><br> Our choices proceed from our brains, and our brains are material. In 
principle, a scientist who assembled one hundred billion neurons one by one 
might build a brain that could do what ours do. Stimulating a brain, depriving 
it of stimuli, or destroying a part of it can alter a person's choices. We do 
not expect scientists to discover a ghost in the machine. 
n103 Although this machine has capacities we do not fathom and is at least 
centuries beyond our ability to duplicate, the idea of a free-will ghost inside 
it is silly. 

<br><br> It follows that when I decided to applaud David Currie's address at the Law 
School's centennial celebration and then did it, my subjective sense of agency 
was an illusion. Within a fraction of a second of the big bang, when the 
universe was the size of a softball, it was inevitable that a person of my 
appearance and with my name--namely me--would applaud Currie's remarks at that 
moment. The idea that my applause, the Ten Commandments, hippopotamuses, the 
Taj Mahal, 

&#160;[*21]&#160; Adolf Hitler, and Starbucks coffee were built into a softball-sized universe 
billions of years ago seems as implausible as the idea that there might be a 
ghost in my head-machine. Moreover, indeterminacy or quantum-style 
randomness--a newcomer to the old contest--is no more convincing as an 
alternative to human agency than determinism. 
n104 Iris Dement says that we must let the mystery be. 
n105 Science should do all it can to trace my applause to its Planck-time origins, 
but you should not mistake science's working assumption for the truth about my 
clapping. 

<br><br> Although whoever has the burden of proof on the issue of autonomy will fail, 
the business of living requires assumptions about the unknowable, and deciding 
which way to bet does not seem difficult. Declaring ourselves powerless when, 
for all we know, we may not be would be foolish. We have meaningful lives and 
perhaps a meaningful universe to gain and nothing whatever to lose by wagering 
on our ability to choose. 
n106 

<br><br> In 1978, at the outset of the sentencing-reform movement, I noted that 
although a corrective for the undue optimism of the past was in order, the 
corrective could be carried too far. People might grow tired of thinking of 
offenders as individuals: 
&quot;Don't tell us that a robber was retarded. We don't care about his problems. We 
don't know what to do about his problems. The most important thing about this 
robber is simply that . . . he committed the same crime as Bonnie and Clyde.&quot; If this sort of sentiment prevailed, I thought that we would lose something as 
human beings. 
n107 

<br><br> Talk of rehabilitation through most of the twentieth century seemed to mask 
only slightly the moral judgments that, almost everyone realized, justified 
criminal punishment. When a judge announced that an offender was young, had no 
prior record, and was therefore a good prospect for rehabilitation, he simply 
declared in twentieth-century code that the offender was not very blameworthy. 
A century 

&#160;[*22]&#160; of consequentialism, however, may persuade Americans actually to become 
Clarence Darrow and to foreswear blame. They already have turned too far from 
the most humane and humanizing of the purposes of punishment.

such abnormality.&quot; The Durham opinion made its author, Chief Judge David Bazelon, an icon of the 
psychiatric profession. The D.C. Circuit abandoned the

United States v Brawner, 471 F2d 969, 981-82 (DC Cir 1972). Despite heated battles over the issue, variations in the phrasing of the

<br><br>n45 Four Attorneys General in the past 35 years have studied or taught (or both) 
at the University of Chicago Law School, and all have played significant roles 
in shaping American criminal justice. Ramsey Clark approved the prosecution of 
Dr. Benjamin Spock, authored some portions of the Omnibus Crime Control and 
Safe Streets Act of 1968, and temporarily brought a halt to widespread FBI 
wiretapping. Clark's predecessor as Attorney General, Nicholas Katzenbach, who 
recently had been a member of the Law School faculty, headed the President's 
Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. Surprisingly, this 
group's 1967 report still provides the best comprehensive treatment of the 
operation and failings of the criminal justice system as a whole. The war on 
terrorism has led Attorney General John Ashcroft (class of 1967) to approve a 
number of procedural innovations, including relaxation of the guidelines for 
undercover FBI investigations promulgated by Attorney General Edward Levi 
(class of 1935, professor, dean of the Law School, and president of the 
University). See Neil A. Lewis, Traces of Terror: The Inquiry; Ashcroft Permits 
F.B.I. to Monitor Internet and Public Activities, NY Times A20 (May 31, 2002)

<br><br>n50 I noted in 1991, 

<br><br> 

<br><br> The change in sentencing philosophy that sentencing guidelines and sentencing 
reform legislation have produced may be attributable partly to limitations of 
language. Describing the appropriate influence of situational and personal 
characteristics on punishment is difficult. Sentencing guidelines have become 
crime tariffs in part because it is easier to write them that way.

&quot;should have priority over other objectives in decisions about how much to punish&quot;). 

<br><br>n52 von Hirsch initially recognized that 
&quot;'seriousness' depends both on the harm done (or risked) by the act and the 
degree of the actor's culpability.&quot; Id at 69. Ultimately, however, he proposed a sentencing scheme with a 
&quot;presumptive sentence&quot; for every offense from which a judge could depart only if a case was 
&quot;out-of-the-ordinary&quot; and then only slightly. Id at 98-102.

<br><br>n63 These other crimes need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and may 
include offenses of which the defendant has been acquitted. See 
United States v Watts, 519 US 148, 156-57 (1997) (&quot;A jury's verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from

Roundtable 391, 397 (1995) (&quot;This not uncommon pattern, where judges use intermediate sanctions for 
offenders other than those program planners had in mind, is often pejoratively 
characterized as 'net widening.'&quot;). The nearly 300 specialized drug courts established in 48 states also seem to 
have widened the net of penal control. These courts have facilitated the felony 
prosecution of defendants who earlier would have been prosecuted for 
misdemeanors if prosecuted at all. Although drug courts emphasize treatment and 
monitoring as their initial response to drug crime (and although their methods 
do seem to reduce drug recidivism slightly), so many of their 
&quot;clients&quot; fail to respond to treatment that the courts ultimately sentence larger 
numbers to prison. See Morris Hoffman, The Drug Court Scandal, 
78 NC L Rev 1437, 1534 (2000) (&quot;Netwidening is so large that, even if drug courts truly were effective in 
reducing recidivism, more drug defendants would continue to jam our prisons

<br><br>n68 The history of the insanity defense can be separated into two periods--the 800 
years prior to 1982 and the 20 years after. The event dividing these periods 
was the acquittal by reason of insanity of John Hinckley following his shooting 
and wounding of President Reagan. During the pre-1982 period, courts and 
legislatures expanded the scope of the insanity defense. In the post-1982 
period, Congress and state legislatures restricted it. They did so by reverting 
to the 1843 M'Naghten or 
&quot;right-wrong&quot; test of insanity, by shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant, by 
authorizing juries in some states to return verdicts of 
&quot;guilty but insane&quot; (meaning 
&quot;guilty&quot;), and in four states by abolishing the insanity defense altogether. See Kadish

<br><br>n87 The parable of the Pulverizer was told to me by David Friedman, but I have 
embellished it. Jeremy Bentham obtained the initial patent on the principle of 
the Pulverizer. He suggested that a forger might be exhibited to the public 
with his hand 
&quot;transfixed by an iron instrument fashioned like a pen,&quot; and a slanderer might be exhibited with his tongue pierced. In both instances, 
the punishment might 
&quot;be made more formidable in appearance than in reality, by dividing the 
instrument in two parts, so that the part which should pierce the offending 
member need not be thicker than a pin, whilst the other part of the instrument 
may be much thicker, and appear to penetrate with all its thickness.&quot; Jeremy Bentham, Principles of Penal Law, in John Bowring, ed, 1 The Works of 
Jeremy Bentham 365, 408 (William Tait 1843). Bentham declared that 
&quot;the apparent punishment . . . does all the service&quot; while

<br><br>n96 Some of the circumstances recited do indicate whether an offender is likely to 
repeat her misconduct and therefore bear on whether punishment would advance 
rehabilitative or incapacitative goals, but several others do not. 

<br><br>n97 Generations of progressives, taught that retribution focuses on the crime and 
rehabilitation on the criminal, may have believed themselves more committed to 
rehabilitation than they were in fact. Their principal commitment may have been 
simply to recognizing the importance of an offender's personal circumstances in 
determining his punishment.

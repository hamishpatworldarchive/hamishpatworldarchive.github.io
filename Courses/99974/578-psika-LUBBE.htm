<br>
<strong>HEADNOTE:</strong>
<br>In 1997 in a number of actions begun in England the plaintiffs, who were almost 
all South African citizens resident in South Africa, claimed damages for 
personal injury, and in some cases death, against the defendant, a company 
registered in England which owned a number of subsidiary companies in South 
Africa engaged in the mining and processing of asbestos and the sale of 
asbestos-related products.  The plaintiffs alleged that, in respect of periods 
before 1979, the defendant, while knowing of the injurious effect of exposure 
to asbestos, had failed, as the parent company, to take appropriate steps to 
ensure the adoption of proper working practices and safety precautions 
throughout its subsidiary companies and had thereby acted in breach of a duty 
of care it owed to employees of its subsidiary companies or to those living in 
the area of their operations.  The defendant, which had ceased to trade in 
South Africa and had no assets there, sought to stay the first action and, on 
the hearing of the application, undertook to submit to that jurisdiction.  The 
judge granted the stay, concluding that South Africa was the natural forum and 
that justice did not require him to order otherwise.  On the plaintiffs' 
appeal, the Court of Appeal considered that the judge had failed to take into 
account that the South African forum was unavailable to the plaintiffs until 
the undertakings had been given and that its availability remained conditional 
on their being fulfilled.  The court concluded that the defendant had not shown 
South Africa to be clearly the more appropriate forum and allowed the appeal.  

<br><br>Thereafter writs in nine further actions were issued by more than 3,000 
plaintiffs, South African citizens resident in South Africa, who made similar 
allegations against the defendant.  Those cases were ordered to proceed as a 
group action and the defendant applied for a stay of all the proceedings 
against it.  The judge, considering South Africa to be clearly the more 
appropriate forum and rejecting the plaintiffs' objection that legal aid would 
not be available to them there, concluded that there was no sufficient reason 
to refuse a stay and granted the defendant's application.  On the plaintiffs' 
appeal the Court of Appeal, aware that legal aid had been withdrawn from 
personal injury cases in South Africa, considered that the actions had their 
most real and substantial connection there, that convenience and expense 
pointed to that forum and that considerations of public interest supported that 
conclusion.  The court, expressing confidence that legal representation could 
be made available there to the extent necessary to achieve proper consideration 
of the plaintiffs' cases, dismissed their appeal.  

<br><br>On the defendant's appeal against the decision of the first Court of Appeal and 
the plaintiffs' appeal against the decision of the second Court of Appeal:- 

<br><br>Held, (1) dismissing the defendant's appeal, that, where a plaintiff sued a 
defendant as of right in the English court the defendant's application for a 
stay on the ground of forum non conveniens could not succeed unless the court 
was satisfied that there was another tribunal of competent jurisdiction in 
which the case might be tried more suitably for the interests of all the 
parties and for the ends of justice; that the defendant, in undertaking to 
submit to the South African jurisdiction, had sufficiently satisfied the 
requirement that the alternative forum was available and, since the 
undertakings were before the judge when he considered the issue of forum non 
conveniens, their timing was not a relevant factor for the first Court of 
Appeal to have taken into account; but that, on the plaintiffs' case as then 
presented, the first Court of Appeal's assessment of the balance between the 
issues relating to the responsibility of the defendant parent company and the 
personal injury claims was not shown to be unreasonable or wrong and it was 
open to that court to conclude that South Africa was not clearly the more 
appropriate forum (post, pp 1553H-1554A, 1556C-E, 1562B-E, 1565H-1566B, 1567D). 
 

<br><br>Sim v Robinow (1892) 19 R 665 applied.  

<br><br>(2) Allowing the plaintiffs' appeal, that, given the enhanced significance of 
the personal injury issues after the institution of the nine further actions, 
both the judge on the second stay application and the second Court of Appeal 
had correctly regarded South Africa as clearly the more appropriate forum; but 
that since the proceedings could only be handled efficiently, cost-effectively 
and expeditiously on a group basis, since the preparation and conduct of the 
personal injury issues, if the plaintiffs succeeded on the defendant's 
responsibility issue, was a heavy and difficult task requiring the services or 
supervision of professional lawyers and the obtaining of expert advice and 
evidence, and since no convincing evidence suggested the availability of 
appropriate funding in South Africa, whether by legal aid, contingency fee 
arrangements or otherwise, the probable effect of a stay would be to deprive 
the plaintiffs of the means of obtaining the representation and evidence 
essential to the just disposal of their claims, and in consequence would amount 
to a denial of justice; and that, accordingly, in the unusual circumstances of 
the proceedings, lack of means in South Africa to prosecute the claims required 
the stay to be refused (post, pp 1556F-H, 1557E, G-H, 1558E-F, 1559C-G, 
1562B-E, 1567D).  

<br><br>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460, HL(E) and Connelly 
v RTZ Corporation Plc [1998] AC 854, HL(E) applied.  

<br><br>(3) That the principles applied by the court on an application for a stay on 
the ground of forum non conveniens required it to exercise jurisdiction where a 
plaintiff sued the defendant as of right in England unless it was satisfied 
that the case might be tried in the other forum more suitably for the interests 
of all the parties and the ends of justice; and that, accordingly, 
considerations of public interest and public policy which did not relate to the 
private interests of any of the parties and to securing the ends of justice in 
the particular case should be left out of account in determining the 
application (post, pp 1561E-G, 1566C-D, F-1567D).  

<br><br>Decision of the Court of Appeal [1998] CLC 1559 affirmed.  

<br><br>Decision of the Court of Appeal [2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 139 reversed.

<strong>JUDGMENTBY-1:</strong> LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 

<br>
<br>
<strong>JUDGMENT-1:</strong>
<br>LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL: My Lords, the central issue between the plaintiffs 
and the defendant in these interlocutory appeals is whether proceedings brought 
by the plaintiffs against the defendant should be tried in this country or in 
South Africa.  

<br><br>There are at present over 3,000 plaintiffs.  Each of them claims damages in one 
of the 11 writs issued against the defendant between February 1997 and July 
1999.  All the plaintiffs claim damages for personal injuries (and in some 
cases death) allegedly suffered as the result of exposure to asbestos and its 
related products in South Africa.  In some cases the exposure is said to have 
occurred in the course of the plaintiff's employment, in others as a result of 
living in a contaminated area.  The exposure is said to have taken place in 
different places in South Africa and over varying, but sometimes lengthy, 
periods of time, ending for claim purposes in 1979.  One of the plaintiffs (Mrs 
Pauline Nel, suing as personal representative of her deceased husband) is a 
British citizen resident in England.  All the others are South African citizens 
resident in South Africa.  Most of the plaintiffs are black and of modest 
means.  Instructions to sue have been given to English solicitors by more than 
800 additional claimants.  

<br><br>The defendant is a public limited company.  It was incorporated in England in 
1893 under the name Cape Asbestos Company Ltd, principally to mine and process 
asbestos and sell asbestos-related products.  From shortly after 1893 until 
1948 it operated a blue asbestos (or crocidolite) mine at Koegas and a mill at 
Prieska, both in the Northern Cape Province.  In 1925 the defendant acquired 
the shares in two companies, both incorporated in 1916: these were Egnep Ltd 
and Amosa Ltd, which operated a brown asbestos mine and mill at Penge in 
Northern Transvaal.  For practical purposes the head office of these companies 
was in Cape Town.  In 1940 a factory was opened at Benoni, near Johannesburg, 
to manufacture asbestos products.  It was owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
the defendant.  

<br><br>In 1948 the corporate structure of the defendant's group was changed.  The mine 
at Koegas and the mill at Prieska were transferred to a newly-formed South 
African company, Cape Blue Mines (Pty) Ltd.  The shares in Cape Blue Mines, 
Egnep and Amosa were transferred to a newly-formed South African holding 
company, Cape Asbestos South Africa (Pty) Ltd (&quot;CASAP&quot;).  The offices of all these companies were in Johannesburg.  All the shares in 
CASAP were owned by the defendant.  In 1979 CASAP sold its shares in Cape Blue 
Mines, Egnep and Amosa to an unrelated third party buyer, which shortly 
thereafter sold them on.  The defendant continued to hold an interest in the 
South African companies which operated out of the factory at Benoni until 1989 
(although the factory had been closed earlier).  Since then the defendant has 
had no presence anywhere in South Africa, and when the first of the writs in 
the current proceedings was served the defendant had no assets in South Africa. 
 

<br><br>Although originating in South Africa, the defendant's asbestos-related business 
has not been confined to that country.  From 1899 the defendant operated a 
number of factories in England engaged in processing asbestos and manufacturing 
asbestos products.  A factory at Barking was run by the defendant from 1913 
until 1962, and then by a wholly-owned subsidiary until the factory was closed 
in 1968.  Another subsidiary, incorporated in Italy, operated a factory in 
Turin which made asbestos products from 1911 until 1968, with an intermission 
during the war years.
<br><br>Some of the claims made in these actions date back to times when the defendant 
was itself operating in Northern Cape Province.  But the central thrust of the 
claims made by each of the plaintiffs is not against the defendant as the 
employer of that plaintiff or as the occupier of the factory where that 
plaintiff worked, or as the immediate source of the contamination in the area 
where that plaintiff lived.  Rather, the claim is made against the defendant as 
a parent company which, knowing (so it is said) that exposure to asbestos was 
gravely injurious to health, failed to take proper steps to ensure that proper 
working practices were followed and proper safety precautions observed 
throughout the group.  In this way, it is alleged, the defendant breached a 
duty of care which it owed to those working for its subsidiaries or living in 
the area of their operations (with the result that the plaintiffs thereby 
suffered personal injury and loss).  Some 360 claims are made by personal 
representatives of deceased victims.  

<br><br>As reformulated during the first Court of Appeal hearing the main issue raised 
by the plaintiffs' claim was put in this way: 

<br><br>&quot;Whether a parent company which is proved to exercise de facto control over the 
operations of a (foreign) subsidiary and which knows, through its directors, 
that those operations involve risks to the health of workers employed by the 
subsidiary and/or persons in the vicinity of its factory or other business 
premises, owes a duty of care to those workers and/or other persons in relation 
to the control which it exercises over and the advice which it gives to the 
subsidiary company?&quot; 

<br><br>The first of the writs in these proceedings was issued by Mrs 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> and four other plaintiffs on 14 February 1997 (and when she died the action 
was continued by Mr 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> as her personal representative).  The defendant promptly applied to stay the 
proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens.  This application came 
before Mr Michel Kallipetis QC sitting as a deputy judge of the Queen's Bench 
Division, who acceded to it.  He sought to apply the principles authoritatively 
laid down by this House in Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd [1987] 
AC 460, and for reasons given in a lengthy and careful judgment dated 12 
January 1998 he concluded that everything pointed towards South Africa as the 
natural forum for the trial of the action and that there was no pressing 
circumstance which would justify him in deciding that the interests of justice 
required a trial in this country instead of the natural forum in South Africa.  

<br><br>The plaintiffs appealed and on 30 July 1998 the Court of Appeal (Evans, Millett 
and Auld LJJ) allowed the appeal [1998] CLC 1559. Like the judge, the Court of 
Appeal also sought to apply the principles in the Spiliada case.  But it 
reached a different conclusion, holding that the judge had failed to give 
weight to the fact that the negligence alleged was against the defendant 
company as opposed to those persons or companies responsible for running its 
South African businesses from time to time, and that the judge had failed to 
take account of the fact that the South African forum had been unavailable to 
the plaintiffs until the defendant offered undertakings during the hearing 
before the judge, the availability of the South African forum being conditional 
upon those undertakings being fulfilled: see p 1573.  Taking those matters into 
account, the Court of Appeal (&quot;the first Court of Appeal&quot;) held that the defendant did not show that South Africa was clearly and 
distinctly the more appropriate forum.  In fairness to the judge it should be 
observed that the second of these points was not raised before him (it was 
indeed raised by the first Court of Appeal itself) and he could not therefore 
be reproached for failing to take it into account.  

<br><br>At that stage, therefore, the plaintiffs were at liberty to pursue their action 
in England.  Before either of these decisions the sole plaintiff resident in 
England (Mrs Nel) had also issued proceedings as personal representative of her 
husband, joining no other plaintiff.  The defendant sought to challenge the 
decision of the first Court of Appeal but leave to do so was refused by that 
court and, following an oral hearing, by your Lordships' House on 14 December 
1998.  

<br><br>After the refusal of leave by your Lordships in December 1998, writs were 
issued by all the remaining plaintiffs in these proceedings.  It is unnecessary 
to summarise the detailed procedural steps which followed.  It is enough to 
note that the defendant applied to stay all the actions, including the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> action, on grounds of forum non conveniens and abuse of process, and 
directions were given to consolidate the various proceedings (without prejudice 
to the position of the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> plaintiffs) into a group action.  

<br><br>The defendant's summons to stay came before Buckley J who heard detailed 
submissions and considered copious documentary material.  He gave a full 
judgment in writing [2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 139, 141 on 30 July 1999.  He 
concluded that South Africa was clearly and distinctly the more appropriate 
forum for trial of this group action and that there were no sufficient reasons 
for nevertheless refusing a stay: see p 151.  In reaching this last opinion he 
considered and discounted a number of objections raised by the plaintiffs, 
including the alleged unavailability of legal aid in South Africa.  Of that 
submission he said, at p 150: 

<br><br>&quot;In all the circumstances, I cannot find that legal aid would not be granted, if 
applied for in South Africa.  I readily accept there may be difficulties and 
some delay but that, at least in part, must flow from the claimant's decision 
not to apply for legal aid in South Africa and to issue proceedings here, when, 
as [the plaintiffs' solicitor] well knew, the defendant would contest 
jurisdiction.&quot; 

<br><br>The judge accordingly ordered a stay of proceedings.  He considered an argument 
advanced by the defendant that the proceedings were an abuse.  The basis of 
this argument was that the solicitors representing the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> plaintiffs had misled the first Court of Appeal and the House of Lords by 
failing to disclose their intention, if jurisdiction in England was established 
in the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> case, to launch a multi-plaintiff group action, and also that the bringing of 
a group action was oppressive and an abuse.  The judge expressed criticism of 
the solicitors representing the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> plaintiffs but stopped short of finding abuse of the process: see p 154.  The 
judge also considered an argument, advanced by the defendant, suggesting that 
there were public interest grounds for concluding that the proceedings should 
be tried in South Africa: the judge reached his decision independently of this 
argument (see p 154), but considered that it reinforced his decision.  He gave 
both sides leave to appeal.  

<br><br>Thus the matter came before the Court of Appeal (Pill, Aldous and Tuckey LJJ, 
&quot;the second Court of Appeal&quot;) again [2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 139, and in judgments given on 29 November 1999 
the appeals were dismissed.  Pill LJ described the factors pointing towards 
South Africa as the more appropriate forum as 
&quot;overwhelming:&quot; see p 160.  The action had the most real and substantial connection with South 
Africa and considerations of expense and convenience pointed strongly in that 
direction: see p 161.  The public interest considerations supported that 
conclusion: see pp 161-162.  He was not persuaded by the argument that the 
South African High Court would be unable to handle these actions (see p 162), 
and with reference to legal representation he said, at p 164: 

<br><br>&quot;I have already referred to the high repute in which the South African courts 
are held.  There is also in South Africa a legal profession with high standards 
and a tradition of public service, though I do not suggest that lawyers in 
South Africa, any more than those anywhere else, can be expected to act on a 
large scale without prospects of remuneration.  While I would not be prepared 
to apply the second stage of the Spiliada test, so as to permit English 
litigation, even in the absence of evidence that legal representation will be 
available, I am unable to conclude that in the circumstances it would not 
become available for claims in South African courts.  Moreover, given the 
accessibility to the wealth of scientific, technical and medical evidence 
available in this context, I am confident that it could be made available in a 
South African court to the extent required to achieve a proper consideration of 
the plaintiffs' cases.  The action would by no means be novel or speculative.&quot; 

<br><br>Pill LJ was not prepared to strike out the proceedings as an abuse of process: 
see pp 164-165.  He recorded that the plaintiffs had not pursued their 
contention that article 2 of the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the 
Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (1968) (Cmnd 7395) 
deprived the English court of any discretion to stay an action brought against 
a defendant domiciled here, since they did not wish the proceedings to be 
delayed while a reference was made to the European Court of Justice: see pp 
164-165.  He considered that the bringing of the multi-plaintiff group action 
entitled the Court of Appeal to reconsider the decision of the first Court of 
Appeal in the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> action and to reach a different conclusion: see p 165.  He dismissed the 
appeal.  

<br><br>Aldous LJ agreed, while recording earlier reservations about the availability 
of legal representation: see p 166.  He also expressed strong criticism of the 
solicitors representing the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> plaintiffs but agreed with Pill LJ that what had happened did not mean that 
there was an abuse of process such that the group action and the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> action should be stayed: see p 167.  Tuckey LJ also agreed: he deprecated the 
acrimony caused by the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> solicitors' failure to inform the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords of 
the plan to launch a group action and attached less weight than the first Court 
of Appeal had done to the fact that the South African forum had only become 
available because of the defendant's undertaking to submit: see p 168.  The 
second Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal, but leave was given by your 
Lordships to the plaintiffs on 7 February 2000.  On 30 March 2000 your 
Lordships also vacated the earlier order refusing leave to appeal in the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> action and gave leave to the defendant to challenge the decision of the first 
Court of Appeal.  

<br><br>Reference should be made, finally, to an action which is not directly involved 
in these proceedings.  On 3 October 1997 proceedings were issued by Vincenzina 
Gisondi and three other plaintiffs against the defendant making claims on 
grounds similar to those relied on by the plaintiffs in the proceedings before 
the House.  The significant difference is that these plaintiffs complain of 
exposure to asbestos and asbestos products not in South Africa but in Italy.  
Thus the plaintiffs are resident in a state which is a party to the Brussels 
Convention and sue a defendant domiciled in England, another contracting state. 
 It has not been suggested that the English court could under the Convention 
decline jurisdiction in favour of an Italian forum, and no application for a 
stay has been made by the defendant in that case.  There appears to be no 
jurisdictional objection to the prosecution of that action here, and no 
application has been made to strike out the claim as disclosing no cause of 
action.  

<br><br>The applicable principles
<br><br>Where a plaintiff sues a defendant as of right in the English court and the 
defendant applies to stay the proceedings on grounds of forum non conveniens, 
the principles to be applied by the English court in deciding that application 
in any case not governed by article 2 of the Brussels Convention are not in 
doubt.  They derive from the judgment of Lord Kinnear in Sim v Robinow (1892) 
19 R 665, 668 where he said: 

<br><br>&quot;the plea can never be sustained unless the court is satisfied that there is 
some other tribunal, having competent jurisdiction, in which the case may be 
tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of 
justice.&quot; 

<br><br>Thus it is the interest of all the parties, not those of the plaintiff only or 
the defendant only, and the ends of justice as judged by the court on all the 
facts of the case before it, which must control the decision of the court.  In 
the Spiliada case [1987] AC 460, 476 it was stated: 

<br><br>&quot;The basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of forum 
non conveniens where the court is satisfied that there is some other available 
forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the 
trial of the action, ie in which the case may be tried more suitably for the 
interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.&quot; 

<br><br>In applying this principle the court's first task is to consider whether the 
defendant who seeks a stay is able to discharge the burden resting upon him not 
just to show that England is not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial 
but to establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or 
distinctly more appropriate than the English forum.  In this way, proper regard 
is had to the fact that jurisdiction has been founded in England as of right: 
see the Spiliada case, at p 477.  At this first stage of the inquiry the court 
will consider what factors there are which point in the direction of another 
forum: see the Spiliada case [1987] AC 460, 477; Connelly v RTZ Corporation Plc 
[1998] AC 854, 871.  If the court concludes at that stage that there is no 
other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the 
action, that is likely to be the end of the matter.  But if the court concludes 
at that stage that there is some other available forum which prima facie is 
more appropriate for the trial of the action it will ordinarily grant a stay 
unless the plaintiff can show that there are circumstances by reason of which 
justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted.  In this 
second stage the court will concentrate its attention not only on factors 
connecting the proceedings with the foreign or the English forum (the Spiliada 
case, at p 478; the Connelly case, at p 872) but on whether the plaintiff will 
obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction.  The plaintiff will not ordinarily 
discharge the burden lying upon him by showing that he will enjoy procedural 
advantages, or a higher scale of damages or more generous rules of limitation 
if he sues in England; generally speaking, the plaintiff must take a foreign 
forum as he finds it, even if it is in some respects less advantageous to him 
than the English forum (the Spiliada case, at p 482; the Connelly case, at p 
872).  It is only if the plaintiff can establish that substantial justice will 
not be done in the appropriate forum that a stay will be refused (the Spiliada 
case, at p 482; the Connelly case, at p 873).  

<br><br>This is not an easy condition for a plaintiff to satisfy, and it is not 
necessarily enough to show that legal aid is available in this country but not 
in the more appropriate foreign forum.  Lord Goff of Chieveley said in the 
Connelly case, at p 873: 

<br><br>&quot;I therefore start from the position that, at least as a general rule, the court 
will not refuse to grant a stay simply because the plaintiff has shown that no 
financial assistance, for example in the form of legal aid, will be available 
to him in the appropriate forum, whereas such financial assistance will be 
available to him in England.  Many smaller jurisdictions cannot afford a system 
of legal aid.  Suppose that the plaintiff has been injured in a motor accident 
in such a country, and succeeds in establishing English jurisdiction on the 
defendant by service on him in this country where the plaintiff is eligible for 
legal aid, I cannot think that the absence of legal aid in the appropriate 
jurisdiction would of itself justify the refusal of a stay on the ground of 
forum non conveniens.  In this connection it should not be forgotten that 
financial assistance for litigation is not necessarily regarded as essential, 
even in sophisticated legal systems.  It was not widely available in this 
country until 1949; and even since that date it has been only available for 
persons with limited means.  People above that limit may well lack the means to 
litigate, which provides one reason for the recent legalisation of conditional 
fee agreements.  Even so, the availability of financial assistance in this 
country, coupled with its non-availability in the appropriate forum, may 
exceptionally be a relevant factor in this context.  The question, however, 
remains whether the plaintiff can establish that substantial justice will not 
in the particular circumstances of the case be done if the plaintiff has to 
proceed in the appropriate forum where no financial assistance is available.&quot; 

<br><br>In the Connelly case a majority of the House held that the case before it was 
such an exceptional case.  The nature and complexity of the case were such that 
it could not be tried at all without the benefit of legal representation and 
expert scientific assistance, available in this country but not in the more 
appropriate forum, Namibia.  That being so, the majority of the House concluded 
that the Namibian forum was not one in which the case could be tried more 
suitably for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice.  

<br><br>The present cases 

<br><br>The issues in the present cases fall into two segments.  The first segment 
concerns the responsibility of the defendant as a parent company for ensuring 
the observance of proper standards of health and safety by its overseas 
subsidiaries.  Resolution of this issue will be likely to involve an inquiry 
into what part the defendant played in controlling the operations of the group, 
what its directors and employees knew or ought to have known, what action was 
taken and not taken, whether the defendant owed a duty of care to employees of 
group companies overseas and whether, if so, that duty was broken.  Much of the 
evidence material to this inquiry would, in the ordinary way, be documentary 
and much of it would be found in the offices of the parent company, including 
minutes of meetings, reports by directors and employees on visits overseas and 
correspondence.  

<br><br>The second segment of the cases involves the personal injury issues relevant to 
each individual: diagnosis, prognosis, causation (including the contribution 
made to a plaintiff's condition by any sources of contamination for which the 
defendant was not responsible) and special damage.  Investigation of these 
issues would necessarily involve the evidence and medical examination of each 
plaintiff and an inquiry into the conditions in which that plaintiff worked or 
lived and the period for which he did so.  Where the claim is made on behalf of 
a deceased person the inquiry would be essentially the same, although probably 
more difficult.  

<br><br>In his review of the 
<strong>Lubbe</strong> case, which was alone before him, Mr Kallipetis considered that the 
convenience of trying the personal injury issues in South Africa outweighed any 
benefit there might be in trying the parent company responsibility issue here.  
That was in my opinion a tenable though not an inevitable conclusion on the 
case as then presented.  The two reasons given by the first Court of Appeal for 
disturbing that exercise of judgment are not to my mind convincing.  Mr 
Kallipetis's judgment does not suggest that he overlooked the way in which the 
plaintiffs put their case, although he did not express it very clearly (perhaps 
because the pleading Was not very clear).  The first Court of Appeal thought it 
undermined the defendant's application for a stay that the South African forum 
only became available as a result of the defendant's undertaking to submit, but 
for reasons given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead (with 
which I fully agree) this was not a factor which should have weighed in the 
balance either way.  I would not accept the argument advanced by the plaintiffs 
on this point.  I question whether the first Court of Appeal was justified in 
disturbing Mr Kallipetis's conclusion and substituting its own.  But its own 
assessment of the balance between the parent company responsibility issue and 
the personal injury issues is not shown to be unreasonable or Wrong.  On the 
case as then presented there was room for the view that South Africa was not 
shown to be a clearly more appropriate forum.  This is a field in which 
differing conclusions can be reached by different tribunals without either 
being susceptible to legal challenge.  The jurisdiction to stay is liable to be 
perverted if parties litigate the issue at different levels of the judicial 
hierarchy in the hope of persuading a higher court to strike a different 
balance in the factors pointing for and against a foreign forum.  

<br><br>The emergence of over 3,000 new plaintiffs following the decision of the first 
Court of Appeal had an obvious and significant effect on the balance of the 
proceedings.  While the parent company responsibility issue remained very much 
what it had always been, the personal injury issues assumed very much greater 
significance.  To investigate, prepare and resolve these issues, in relation to 
each of the plaintiffs, would plainly involve a careful, detailed and 
cumbersome factual inquiry and, at least potentially, a very large body of 
expert evidence.  In this changed situation Buckley J, applying the first stage 
of the Spiliada test, regarded South Africa as clearly the more appropriate 
forum for trial of the group action and the second Court of Appeal agreed.  
Both courts were in my view plainly correct.  The enhanced significance of the 
personal injury issues tipped the balance very clearly in favour of South 
Africa at the first stage of the Spiliada exercise, and no effective criticism 
has been made of that conclusion.  The brunt of the plaintiffs' argument on 
these appeals to the House has been directed not against the decisions of 
Buckley J and the second Court of Appeal on the first stage of the Spiliada 
test but against their conclusion that the plaintiffs had not shown that 
substantial justice would not be done in the more appropriate South African 
forum.  

<br><br>Funding 

<br><br>The plaintiffs submitted that legal aid in South Africa had been withdrawn for 
personal injury claims, that there was no reasonable likelihood of any lawyer 
or group of lawyers being able or willing to fund proceedings of this weight 
and complexity under the contingency fee arrangements permitted in South Africa 
since April 1999 and that there was no other available source of funding open 
to the plaintiffs.  These were, they argued, proceedings which could not be 
effectively prosecuted without legal representation and adequate funding.  To 
stay proceedings in England, where legal representation and adequate funding 
are available, in favour of the South African forum where they are not would 
accordingly deny the plaintiffs any realistic prospect of pursuing their claims 
to trial.  

<br><br>The defendant roundly challenged these assertions.  Reliance was placed on the 
facts that the plaintiffs had not applied for legal aid in South Africa before 
its withdrawal and had made no determined effort to obtain funding in South 
Africa.  Even if legal aid was no longer available in South Africa, contingency 
fee agreements were now permissible and it was unrealistic to suppose that 
South African counsel and attorneys would be any less ready to act than English 
counsel and solicitors if the claims were judged to have a reasonable prospect 
of success.  If contingency fee arrangements could not be made in South Africa 
because South African counsel and attorneys did not judge the claims to have a 
reasonable prospect of success, that did not involve a denial of justice to the 
plaintiffs.  In any event there were other potential sources of assistance 
available to the plaintiffs in South Africa.  

<br><br>The material placed before the House (and the lower courts) relevant to these 
issues is very extensive and cannot conveniently be summarised.  The following 
conclusions are in my opinion to be drawn from it.  

<br><br>(1) The proceedings as now constituted can only be handled efficiently, 
cost-effectively and expeditiously on a group basis.  It is impossible at this 
stage to predict with accuracy what procedural directions might on that basis 
be given in future (although the directions could only relate to the conduct of 
proceedings in England).  Obvious possibilities include the trial of a 
preliminary issue on the parent company responsibility question and the trial 
of selected lead cases to test the outcome in different factual situations.  It 
would be very highly desirable, if possible, to avoid determination of these 
claims on a plaintiff by plaintiff basis.  

<br><br>(2) The plaintiffs' claims raise a serious legal issue concerning the duty of 
the defendant as a parent company, and it would be necessary to decide whether 
that duty was governed by English or South African law.  If a duty were held to 
exist, there would be a serious factual issue whether the defendant was in 
breach of it.  If the plaintiffs were successful on these questions, the 
personal injury issues would have, even in the context of a group action, to be 
investigated, prepared and quantified.  This would be a heavy and difficult 
task.  It could only be done by, or under the supervision of, professional 
lawyers.  It would call for high quality expert advice and evidence, certainly 
on medical and industrial issues, very possibly on other issues also.  I see no 
reason to question the judgment of a South African attorney instructed by the 
defendant who swore: 

<br><br>&quot;The magnitude and complexity of both the factual and legal issues will require 
the application in South Africa of considerable financial resources and 
manpower, if there is to be any reasonable prospect of addressing the 
plaintiffs' allegations meaningfully.&quot; 

<br><br>It is significant that Professor Unterhalter, an independent expert approached 
by the defendant, observed: 

<br><br>&quot;Detailed expert evidence would be required on a number of aspects of the 
matter.  Without agreement between the parties as to how the issues might be 
limited, I would venture no opinion as to the length and magnitude of this 
litigation, save to say that it is likely to be drawn out and complex, and 
would almost certainly come before the Supreme Court of Appeal in due course.&quot; 

<br><br>(3) A possibility must exist that the proceedings may culminate in settlement.  
The plaintiffs confidently predict such an outcome if they succeed on the 
parent company responsibility issue.  But the defendant has given no indication 
that the claims will not be fully contested.  In the Spiliada case Staughton J 
thought it right to decide the stay application on the assumption that there 
would be a trial, and it would seem to me wrong in principle to reject a 
submission that justice will not be done in a foreign forum on the basis of a 
speculative assumption that, if a stay is granted, proceedings in the foreign 
forum will culminate in a just settlement without the need for a trial.  

<br><br>(4) In a letter dated 20 September 1999 to Leigh Day 
&amp; Co representing some of the plaintiffs, the Legal Aid Board of South Africa 
wrote: 

<br><br>&quot;It will however be of interest to you to note that on 13 September 1999 the 
Legal Aid Board resolved, because of the financial crisis faced by it, as per 
the attached letter to the Minister of Justice, to exclude from the operation 
of the legal aid scheme operated by the South African Legal Aid Board with 
effect from 1 November 1999 funding in respect of personal injury claims and 
all other claims sounding in the money.&quot; 

<br><br>Other material before the House makes plain that before this decision the Legal 
Aid Board had experienced a period of extreme financial stringency.  Despite 
suggestions to the contrary there is no convincing evidence to suggest that 
legal aid might be made available in South Africa to fund this potentially 
protracted and expensive litigation.  Written submissions on behalf of the 
Republic of South Africa contain no hint that public funds might, 
exceptionally, be made available to fund it.  

<br><br>(5) The South African Contingency Fees Act (No 66 of 1997) sanctioned a new 
regime similar (although not identical) to that governing conditional fees in 
this country.  It enables counsel and attorneys to undertake work for 
plaintiffs on the basis that if the claim is successful they will receive a fee 
in excess of that ordinarily chargeable, and that they receive nothing if the 
claim fails.  This regime does not apply to the fees of expert witnesses, who 
may not be engaged on the basis that they are paid only if the plaintiff by 
whom they are called is successful.  The defendant referred to an affidavit 
sworn by very experienced South African counsel who deposed: 

<br><br>&quot;In my view, if a firm of attorneys with a reasonable infrastructure is of the 
view that the claims of the present plaintiffs are good, this would mean that 
the firm would be able to earn very substantial sums of money by way of fees.  
At the same time, one should not lose sight of the fact that this case is 
likely to have a very high profile and that the plaintiffs' attorney(s) would 
be accorded a great deal of positive publicity in the media.  This would be a 
further inducement to take on a case of this nature.  There is every reason to 
believe that there would be no shortage of firms of attorneys who would be 
desirous of taking on such a case if they believed that it had good prospects 
of success.  Accordingly, if there are attorneys in South Africa who are as 
positive about the prospects of success as [the plaintiffs' solicitor] is (as 
conveyed in his affidavit), I feel sure that there will be no lack of attorneys 
in South Africa prepared to represent these plaintiffs under contingency fee 
arrangements.&quot; 

<br><br>This very general assertion of belief by a member of the Bar was flatly 
contradicted by a number of other equally distinguished counsel who provided 
sworn statements to the plaintiffs, and counsel for the defendant indicated 
that he placed no reliance on it.  More significantly, it received no support 
from any practising attorney, and it would be attorneys who would be required, 
if these proceedings were undertaken for the plaintiffs on a contingency fee 
basis, to finance the investigation of the claims, the obtaining and calling of 
evidence and the conduct of the trial during a period which would inevitably 
last for months and, very much more probably, years.  The clear, strong and 
unchallenged view of the attorneys who provided statements to the plaintiffs 
was that no firm of South African attorneys with expertise in this field had 
the means or would undertake the risk of conducting these proceedings on a 
contingency fee basis.  The defendant suggested that financial support and 
professional assistance might be given to the plaintiffs by the Legal Resources 
Centre, but this suggestion was authoritatively contradicted.  In a recent 
affidavit the possibility was raised that assistance might be forthcoming from 
the European Union Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa, but the 
evidence did not support the possibility of assistance on the scale necessary 
to fund this litigation.  

<br><br>(6) If these proceedings were stayed in favour of the more appropriate forum in 
South Africa the probability is that the plaintiffs would have no means of 
obtaining the professional representation and the expert evidence which would 
be essential if these claims were to be justly decided.  This would amount to a 
denial of justice.  In the special and unusual circumstances of these 
proceedings, lack of the means, in South Africa, to prosecute these claims to a 
conclusion provides a compelling ground, at the second stage of the Spiliada 
test, for refusing to stay the proceedings here.  

<br><br>(7) The conclusions on the funding issue reached by the second Court of Appeal 
did not in my opinion take account of the evidence, which did not permit the 
finding which the court made.  

<br><br>The plaintiffs, as a ground for challenging the appropriateness of the South 
African forum, relied on the absence of established procedures in South Africa 
for handling group actions such as the present.  They compared that situation 
with the procedural situation here, where the conduct of group actions is 
governed by a recently-developed but now tried and established framework of 
rules, practice directions and subordinate legislation.  I do not regard this 
objection, standing alone, as compelling.  It involves the kind of procedural 
comparison which the English court should be careful to eschew (the Spiliada 
case, at p 482; the Connelly case, at p 872), and the evidence is clear that 
South African courts have inherent jurisdiction to adopt procedures appropriate 
to the cases they are called upon to handle.  There is force in the 
observations of Pill LJ [2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 139, 162: 

<br><br>&quot;I am entirely unpersuaded by arguments that the South African High Court would 
be unable to handle these actions efficiently either on the ground that there 
are territorial divisions within South Africa or because there is at present no 
procedure expressly providing for group actions.  It is common ground that the 
law potentially to be applied is the same throughout South Africa.  In England, 
there has been a vast amount of litigation by victims of asbestos dust without 
resort to group actions.  Whether by a form of group action or otherwise, I 
have no doubt that the High Court of South Africa will be able to devise and 
adopt suitable procedures for the efficient despatch of business such as this.  
None of the evidence or submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs suggests any 
significant obstacle to that efficient despatch by the court of cases before it.&quot;
<br><br>I do, however, think that the absence, as yet, of developed procedures for 
handling group actions in South Africa reinforces the submissions made by the 
plaintiffs on the funding issue.  It is one thing to embark on and fund a heavy 
group action where the procedures governing the conduct of the proceedings are 
known to and understood by experienced judges and practitioners.  It may be 
quite another where the exercise is novel and untried.  There must then be an 
increased likelihood of interlocutory decisions which are contentious, with the 
likelihood of appeals and delay.  It cannot be assumed that all judges will 
respond to this new procedural challenge in the same innovative spirit.  The 
exercise of jurisdiction by the South African High Court through separate 
territorial divisions, while not a potent obstacle in itself, could contribute 
to delay, uncertainty and cost.  The procedural novelty of these proceedings, 
if pursued in South Africa, must in my view act as a further disincentive to 
any person or body considering whether or not to finance the proceedings.  

<br><br>Third parties 

<br><br>Both before Buckley J and the second Court of Appeal it was contended by the 
defendant and accepted as a factor pointing towards the appropriateness of the 
South African forum that the defendant, if sued there, could make and enforce 
claims against third parties who could be shown to have contributed to the 
plaintiffs' condition, whereas it might be difficult to join such parties and 
enforce judgments if the actions were pursued here.  The plaintiffs have sought 
to meet this point by questioning whether, in truth, the defendant has 
disclosed any potential claim against an identified third party with assets or 
insurance sufficient to meet any significant claim; by relying on Court of 
Appeal authority (see Holtby v Brigham 
&amp; Cowan (Hull) Ltd [2000] 3 All ER 421) for the proposition that a defendant is 
only liable for such proportion of a plaintiff's damage as he is shown to have 
caused; and by formally undertaking, in asbestos (but not mesothelioma) cases, 
to limit their claim to compensation for loss and damage for asbestos-related 
disease to such sum as would reflect the proportion of a plaintiff's total 
asbestos exposure as was shown to be the defendant's responsibility.  The 
courts below were in my judgment right to treat the third party consideration 
as one strengthening the appropriateness of the South African forum, but I am 
persuaded by the plaintiffs' response that the refusal of a stay will not 
expose the defendant to a significant risk of prejudice so long as any new 
claimants are admitted to the group only upon their binding themselves by the 
undertaking of the present plaintiffs.  

<br><br>Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights
<br><br>The plaintiffs submitted that to stay these proceedings in favour of the South 
African forum would violate the plaintiffs' rights guaranteed by article 6 of 
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms (1953) (Cmd 8969) since it would, because of the lack of funding and 
legal representation in South Africa, deny them a fair trial on terms of 
litigious equality with the defendant.  For reasons already given, I have 
concluded that a stay would lead to a denial of justice to the plaintiffs.  
Since, as the Spiliada case [1987] AC 460 makes clear, a stay will not be 
granted where it is established by cogent evidence that the plaintiff will not 
obtain justice in the foreign forum, I cannot conceive that the court would 
grant a stay in any case where adequate funding and legal representation of the 
plaintiff were judged to be necessary to the doing of justice and these were 
clearly shown to be unavailable in the foreign forum although available here.  
I do not think article 6 supports any conclusion which is not already reached 
on application of Spiliada principles.  I cannot, however, accept the view of 
the second Court of Appeal that it would be right to decline jurisdiction in 
favour of South Africa even if legal representation were not available there.  

<br><br>Public interest
<br><br>Both the plaintiffs and the defendant placed reliance on public interest 
considerations as strengthening their contentions that these proceedings should 
be tried in the forum for which they respectively contended.  I agree with my 
noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, for the reasons which he 
gives, that public interest considerations not related to the private interests 
of the parties and the ends of justice have no bearing on the decision which 
the court has to make.  Where a catastrophe has occurred in a particular place, 
the facts that numerous victims live in that place, that the relevant evidence 
is to be found there and that site inspections are most conveniently and 
inexpensively carried out there will provide factors connecting any ensuing 
litigation with the court exercising jurisdiction in that place.  These are 
matters of which the Spiliada test takes full account.  It is important that 
the focus should remain on the principle so clearly stated by Lord Kinnear: in 
applying this principle questions of judicial amour propre and political 
interest or responsibility have no part to play.  

<br><br>Article 2 of the Brussels Convention
<br><br>The House received and heard erudite argument on the applicability of article 2 
of the Brussels Convention to a case such as the present.  The plaintiffs 
submitted that the court was precluded by article 2 from granting a stay.  The 
defendant argued that the jurisdiction of the court to grant a stay in favour 
of a forum in a non-contracting state was unaffected by article 2.  The 
correctness of the Court of Appeal decision in In re Harrods (Buenos Aires) Ltd 
[1992] Ch 72 was in issue.  Both parties argued that the answer for which they 
respectively contended was clearly correct.  If it was not, the plaintiffs 
invited the House to seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice, a course 
which the defendant resisted.  

<br><br>For reasons already given, I am unwilling to stay the plaintiffs' proceedings 
in this country.  It is accordingly unnecessary to decide whether the effect of 
article 2 is to deprive the English court of jurisdiction to grant a stay in a 
case such as this.  Had it been necessary to resolve that question, I would 
have thought it necessary to seek a ruling on the applicability on article 2 
from the European Court of Justice, since I do not consider the answer to that 
question to be clear.  

<br><br>Conclusion 

<br><br>I would dismiss the defendant's appeal against the decision of the first Court 
of Appeal.  I would allow the plaintiffs' appeal against the decision of the 
second Court of Appeal and remove the stay which that court upheld.  The 
defendant must bear the costs of both appeals, and also the costs of the 
proceedings before Buckley J and the second Court of Appeal.

<strong>JUDGMENT-4:</strong>
<br>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD: My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading in draft 
the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I agree 
with it, and for the reasons which he has given I, too, would allow the 
claimants' appeals and dismiss the appeal by the defendant.  I should however 
like to add some observations on two matters that were raised in the course of 
the argument about the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  

<br><br>Available forum
<br><br>It is clear that the decision of the first Court of Appeal [1998] CLC 1559 to 
refuse a stay was much influenced by the view which they formed about the 
defendant's submission that the South African courts were available to the 
plaintiffs because it had offered during the hearing before the judge to submit 
to the jurisdiction of those courts.  

<br><br>It was not suggested to the judge that there were any reasons for doubting that 
this offer had removed the difficulty that the defendant was not otherwise 
subject to the jurisdiction of the South African courts as it was neither 
present nor had any assets in South Africa.  But in the Court of Appeal it was 
contended that the offer was objectionable, for two reasons.  The first was 
that the courts in South Africa were not available at the time when the 
plaintiffs brought their proceedings in England, as the defendant did not 
indicate its willingness to be sued in South Africa until after the proceedings 
had been brought.  The second was that the effect of treating the South African 
courts as available in these circumstances was to give the defendant a choice 
of jurisdiction, enabling it to elect for the court that was more favourable to 
it and thus indulge in forum shopping.  Evans LJ did not go so far in his 
judgment as to say that the South African courts were not to be regarded as 
available in these circumstances.  But he made it clear that in his opinion the 
fact that the South African courts were not available until the defendant 
offered the undertakings, and that their availability remained conditional upon 
them, were factors which should be taken into account in the application to the 
case of the principles stated in Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd 
[1987] AC 460.  The implication was that these were factors to be weighed in 
the balance against the defendant in the decision whether or not the action 
should be stayed.  

<br><br>This is not a point that required to be considered in Connelly v RTZ 
Corporation Plc [1998] AC 854, and I think that counsel for the defendant was 
in error when he submitted to the Court of Appeal in the present case that it 
could have been: [1998] CLC 1559, 1565F. In Connelly's case the two defendant 
companies, like the defendant in this case, were English companies which had 
their registered offices in England.  But the basis upon which they were being 
sued in England was that they were responsible, either directly in fact or 
vicariously in law, for defects in the health and safety arrangements at the 
mine which was operated in Namibia by a subsidiary of the first defendant by 
whom the plaintiff was employed while he was working there: see the issues 
which were identified in the Court of Appeal by Waite LJ [1996] QB 361, 364B-D. 
 The subsidiary, against which the plaintiff had previously directed his claim 
at the suggestion of the first defendant, was present and available to be sued 
in Namibia.  It was common ground that Namibia was a forum that was available 
to the plaintiff for his claim of damages.  No doubt this was on the view that 
for all practical purposes no distinction was to be drawn between the first 
defendant, which as my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, observed [1998] 
AC 854, 876G, was a multinational company present almost everywhere, and its 
subsidiary in Namibia.  

<br><br>In the present case the asbestos mines and mills in South Africa which were 
operated by the defendant's subsidiaries are all closed, and its subsidiaries 
are no longer present or available to be sued in that country.  The question 
whether the South African courts are available to the claimants is thus 
entirely dependent upon the proposition that the defendant itself is subject to 
the jurisdiction of those courts.  As the defendant has no presence in that 
country, and as it has no assets there which could be attached to found 
jurisdiction, the only ground on which its courts could exercise jurisdiction 
against it is that of prorogation.  The validity of the defendant's 
undertakings is therefore critical to its argument that the South African 
courts are available to the claimants as a forum in which their actions should 
be tried.  

<br><br>The approach that is to be taken to this question has been examined in a number 
of Scottish cases to which it may be helpful to refer, as the underlying 
principles which Lord Goff of Chieveley described in the Spiliada case were 
derived from the Scottish authorities.  

<br><br>In Clements v Macaulay (1866) 4 Macph 583 an objection was taken to the 
jurisdiction of the Scottish courts in an action to enforce a contract entered 
into between two Americans on the plea of forum non competens.  This was on the 
grounds that Texas where the agreement was entered into was the only proper 
forum for the dispute and that the Scottish court was an inconvenient and 
improper forum.  The Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Inglis, having concluded that the 
view that the courts of Texas would have jurisdiction was plainly untenable, 
said, at p 592: 

<br><br>&quot;But then I am bound to inquire, if this is an inconvenient and incompetent 
forum, where is the proper forum?  Apart from the suggestion of Texas, no other 
suggestion is made, and I know no case of a plea of this kind being sustained, 
where the defender did not satisfy the court that there was another court where 
the cause could be tried with advantage to the parties and to the ends of 
justice.  The defender does seem to have thought himself under obligation to 
suggest what was the proper forum, but he has unfortunately suggested one which 
has no jurisdiction.&quot; 

<br><br>Lord Cowan said, at p 594: 

<br><br>&quot;Your Lordship has conclusively shown that there is no jurisdiction in the 
courts of Texas, on the ground stated by the defender, to entertain this 
action.  Where, then, is the forum on which the defence is founded?  When the 
court has given effect to such a plea, it has always been because another 
forum, specially referred to by the defender as that in which he undertakes to 
plead, has been regarded as the more convenient and preferable for securing the 
ends of justice.  Here the elements for disposing of this defence, pleaded on 
this, its essential ground, do not exist.&quot; 

<br><br>In Societe du Gaz de Paris v Societe Anonyme de Navigation 
&quot;Les Armateurs Francais,&quot; 1925 SC 332, 347 the Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Alness, said that the result of 
the cases was that it must be plain that 
&quot;another forum is open to the parties.&quot; His analysis of the law was approved by Lord Dunedin, 1926 SC (HL) 13, 18, in 
your Lordships' House.  There is no indication here or in any of the other 
Scottish cases that this matter ought to be approached on any other basis than 
that this is a requirement that must be satisfied in a practical manner when 
the question of forum non conveniens is being considered by the court.  

<br><br>In Clements v Macaulay the defender did not offer an undertaking to submit to 
the jurisdiction of the Texas courts.  But in Tulloch v Williams (1846) 8 D 657 
two actions had been raised against the defender when he was on a visit to 
Scotland relating to his conduct while acting as the pursuer's commissioner and 
attorney in Jamaica.  He lodged with his defences in each action a minute 
stating that he was ready and willing to answer in the courts of Jamaica to any 
writ or action that the pursuer might bring against him with reference to that 
subject matter.  The Lord Ordinary said that he was not aware of any authority 
for taking the course desired by the defender, which was to decline to proceed 
with the case in the meantime leaving it to the pursuer to institute 
proceedings against the defender in the courts of Jamaica.  In the absence of 
such authority he repelled the plea.  But he invited the pursuer to consider 
the defender's offer as providing the most satisfactory and least expensive way 
of having justice administered between them, saying that to go on with the 
litigation in Scotland could not fail to be productive of much delay and 
additional expense.  In the Inner House the process was sisted for three months 
in the light of these observations to allow the pursuer an opportunity to bring 
an action in the proper court in Jamaica.  Lord President Boyle explained, at p 
659, that it was a question of convenience whether the case should go on in 
Jamaica or whether it should proceed in Scotland upon evidence of the law and 
custom of Jamaica.  

<br><br>It was not suggested in Tulloch v Williams that the fact that the defender did 
not offer to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Jamaica until he 
lodged his defences presented any difficulty, either on the ground that the 
offer came too late or on the ground that he ought not to be allowed to choose 
the jurisdiction in which he was to be sued.  His undertaking was seen as the 
obvious solution to the difficulty that, although the most expedient course in 
the interests of both parties was for the case to be dealt with not in Scotland 
but in Jamaica, the defender was not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Jamaican courts.  

<br><br>In Sim v Robinow, 19 R 665 the defender was sued in Scotland on the ground that 
he had been resident there for more than 40 days.  He maintained that he was 
only a temporary visitor to Scotland, that he was domiciled in South Africa, 
that he intended to return to his business in that country and that the courts 
of that country were the proper forum for determining the matter in dispute as 
they related to transactions between the parties when they were both in South 
Africa.  His plea that the Scottish courts should decline jurisdiction on the 
ground of forum non conveniens was repelled.  Lord Kinnear, who delivered the 
leading judgment, said that he was not satisfied that it had been shown that 
there was another court in which the action ought to be tried as being more 
convenient for all the parties and more suitable for the ends of justice.  In 
regard to the question whether the courts of South Africa were available, he 
noted that the defender had not offered the same undertaking as was offered in 
Tulloch v Williams.  All that he had said was that he intended to go to South 
Africa, as to which Lord Kinnear observed, at p 669: 

<br><br>&quot;I do not think that the pursuer can be asked to wait till the defender carries 
out this intention, or that he ought to be sent to a court which may be unable 
to exercise any jurisdiction over the defender in consequence of his continued 
absence from South Africa.&quot; 

<br><br>He described Tulloch v Williams, at p 669, as a very exceptional case and 
indicated that it ought not to be followed.  But this was not because he 
thought that it was wrong for the court to proceed on the defender's 
undertaking to submit to the jurisdiction of the other court which he offered 
after the action had been raised.  His criticism of the decision in Tulloch's 
case was that the court ought not to have sisted the action for a short period 
to await events, but that it ought to have determined the matter either one way 
or the other there and then.  This was on the ground that, as he put it at p 
669: 

<br><br>&quot;if this court is not a convenient forum for the trial of the cause, then the 
action ought to be dismissed, but, if this court is a convenient forum, then I 
can see no reason why the action should not go on in the ordinary way.&quot; 

<br><br>Under Scots procedure a decree of dismissal is a decree which is used when it 
is intended to decide that the particular action should not be allowed to Fl 
proceed against the defender, but which is intended to leave it open to the 
pursuer to bring another action: Maclaren, Court of Session Practice (1916), p 
1093.  

<br><br>In the light of these authorities I would have regarded the undertakings which 
were offered by the defendant in this case as sufficient to satisfy the 
requirement that the alternative forum in South Africa was available because it 
had undertaken to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of that country.  
Nothing turns on the time when the undertakings were given.  It is sufficient 
that they were before the judge when he was considering the question of forum 
non conveniens.  As for the suggestion that the defendant was choosing its 
jurisdiction and thus indulging in a kind of forum shopping, this overlooks the 
fact that the issue as to forum non conveniens is for the court itself to 
resolve.  It is not a matter that is left to the choice of the defender.  
Furthermore the court resolves the issue by looking to the interests of all 
parties and the ends of justice.  As the Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Alness, said 
in Societe du Gaz de Paris v Societe Anonyme de Navigation 
&quot;Les Armateurs Francais,&quot; 1925 SC 332, 347, it does not do so from the point of view of the defender 
only.  The only purpose of the undertaking is to satisfy the requirement that 
the other forum is available.  The ground on which the jurisdiction of the 
courts in the other forum is available to be exercised is of no importance 
either one way or the other in the application to the case of the Spiliada 
principles.  

<br><br>Public interest 

<br><br>In my opinion the principles on which the doctrine of forum non conveniens rest 
leave no room for considerations of public interest or public policy which 
cannot be related to the private interests of any of the parties or the ends of 
justice in the case which is before the court.  

<br><br>In Societe du Gaz de Paris v Societe Anonyme de Navigation 
&quot;Les Armateurs Francais,&quot; 1925 SC 332, 361, where jurisdiction was established over the defender by an 
arrestment to found jurisdiction, Lord Anderson rejected the extreme argument 
that that case ought not to be litigated in Scotland at all as it was an action 
between two foreigners.  He said: 

<br><br>&quot;Anyone who succeeds in founding jurisdiction in this way seems to me to be 
entitled, as of right, to invoke the exercise of the jurisdiction so founded, 
and the court can only refuse to exercise the jurisdiction invoked if a defence 
of forum non conveniens is established.&quot; 

<br><br>In the House of Lords, 1926 SC (HL) 13, 21 Lord Sumner was alluding to the same 
point when he said: 

<br><br>&quot;Obviously the court cannot allege its own convenience, or the amount of its own 
business, or its distaste for trying actions which involve taking evidence in 
French, as a ground for refusal . . . the court has to proceed until the 
defender objects, but, as against the pursuer's right, the defender has an 
equal right to plead forum non conveniens.&quot; 

<br><br>In MacShannon v Rockware Glass Ltd [1978] AC 795, 822D, Lord Salmon said that 
he did not think that matters of general policy should play any part in 
deciding issues of this kind, and Lord Keith of Kinkel made an observation to 
the same effect, at p 833D.  

<br><br>The proper approach therefore is to start from the proposition that a claimant 
who is able to establish jurisdiction against the defendant as of right in this 
country is entitled to call upon the courts of this country to exercise that 
jurisdiction.  So, if the plea of forum non conveniens cannot be sustained on 
the ground that the case may be tried more suitably in the other forum, in the 
words of Lord Kinnear in Sim v Robinow, 19 R 665, 668, 
&quot;for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice,&quot; the jurisdiction must be exercised -- however desirable it may be on grounds 
of public interest or public policy that the litigation should be conducted 
elsewhere and not in the English courts.  On the other hand, if the interests 
of all parties and the ends of justice require that the action in this country 
should be stayed, a stay ought to be granted however desirable it may be on 
grounds of public interest or public policy that the action should be tried 
here.  

<br><br>I would therefore decline to follow those judges in the United States who would 
decide issues as to where a case ought to be tried on broad grounds of public 
policy: see Union Carbide Corporation Gas Plant Disaster at Bhopal, India in 
December 1984 (1986) 634 F Supp 842 and Piper Aircraft Co v Reyno (1981) 454 US 
235. I respectfully agree with Deane J's observation in Oceanic Sun Line 
Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay (1988) 165 CLR 197, 255 that the court is not 
equipped to conduct the kind of inquiry and assessment of the international as 
well as the domestic implications that would be needed if it were to follow 
that approach.  However tempting it may be to give effect to concerns about the 
expense and inconvenience to the administration of justice of litigating 
actions such as these in this country on the one hand or in South Africa on the 
other, the argument must be resolved upon an examination of their effect upon 
the interests of the parties who are before the court and securing the ends of 
justice in their case.  I would hold that considerations of policy which cannot 
be dealt with in this way should be left out of account in the application to 
the case of the Spiliada principles.
